## The HR department at Salifort Motors is keen to enhance employee satisfaction by predicting whether an employee is likely to leave the company based on various factors. To achieve this, they have collected employee data that includes key variables influencing employee turnover. The goal of this project is to conduct an in-depth analysis of the dataset and develop predictive models to identify patterns and factors contributing to employee attrition.

###The deliverables include:

  # Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to understand trends and correlations in the dataset.
  # Feature engineering to transform raw data into meaningful variables.
  # Predictive modeling using machine learning techniques (e.g., logistic regression, decision trees, random forests, XGBoost) to forecast employee turnover.
  # Model evaluation and selection to identify the best-performing model.
  # Actionable insights for the HR department to help mitigate employee attrition and improve retention.
These insights will assist the HR team in making informed decisions to foster a better working environment, leading to increased employee satisfaction and reduced turnover.
